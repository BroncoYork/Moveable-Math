# Moveable-Math


Movable math is a product that allows students to learn fundamental algebra through exploration of the environment of an equation. It utilizes physical pieces connected to software that updates in real time with the actions of the student. 

In this repository you will find the MATLAB software used to determine resistor values, arduino code to read user actions, and python code to display user changes on a GUI. Additionally, you will see the DXF files used for laser cutting and images of our design process. 

More information can be found [here](https://movablemath.com/) on our website. 




This project was developed as part of the University of Pittsburgh Swanson School of Engineering course ENGR 0716 - The Art of Making: An Introduction to Hands-On System Design and Engineering.
